# The Emoji Project
## The Project Formerly Known as Slack Icons

Project initially started by gathering icons / emoji for Slack; however the emojis / icons here can easily be used with Discord, Mastodon, etc.

## PRs Welcome, Please Note

I'll admit that I don't normally check for PRs / Issues because this isn't something that's historically been used by anyone else but me as far as I know. So if you do have an PR / Issue that you've submitted and we happen to be in a shared Slack (or Discord) I'd recommend DMing me there. 😅

### Rules for Adding Images

The majority of the Icons / Emoji in here are a combination of images that I've made into the appropriate size (max 128 px width / height) or ones that I've found in communities and workplaces I've been in. If you have a ones that you'd like to submit, please feel free! That said:

* No faces, unless they're "meme'd" faces (e.g. Picard for Facepalm). This is to prevent any company/community specific people from ending up in a public repo. I will be avoiding the mental exercise of "who is _technically_ a public figure and according to whom", which means I will reject images if there's a grey area.
* Similarly, if there are images that you know are restricted to your org for any reason, even if they aren't faces, don't submit them. Things that don't "look private" I may not catch, so I am relying on the submitter's (your) integrity.
* Try to follow the directory pattern when submitting. Once an icon "family" has more than a few members they usually get a dedicated folder. For example, one mario-dancing icon is just in the parent folder for `Memes Games TV Movies`; however. if you're submitting a set of them move the one or two existing into a Mario (or whatever) subfolder and then add yours for the PR.
* Also: when an icon type is specific and has a "family" pattern, then the icon names need to be shifted to that pattern. Easy example is the "party parrot" series (common in Slacks / Discords, so they aren't in this repo). The folder would be "Party Parrot" and the icons would all be named the pattern "party-parrot-xxxx" where xxxx is "conga" or whatever. So if you create a "family" pattern as mentioned in the previous, make sure you update the naming pattern of any icons you copy into the new subdirectory.
* Respect dash vs underscore convensions. In this repo they're all dashes for consistency. Please adjust for whatever naming convensions your org uses when you upload them there.
* If you have emoji you would like to submit but aren't sure where to put them, when you create your PR please:
  * Create a new subdirectory under `images` and name it whatever you'd like
  * Call this out when you create the PR itself, e.g. "Not sure where to put these, they are all in the `NEW` directory.

**Note** I keep backlogging a way to batch load the emoji into a Slack, mainly because this project gets the most attention when I join an org and start adding them, so. Anyway if anyone wants to PR or submit thoughts for that feel free.
